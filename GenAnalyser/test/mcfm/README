1) Install and makefile ---> they are modified in order to use, if you want LHAPDF on a lxplus


2) src/User/gencuts.f

   fortran routine where all the selection that you define in the .DAT file are 
   implemented. This version in corrected respect to mcfm 6.0 default version in order to
   apply both the selections defined here + what is written in wbfcuts.f   

3) src/User/wbfcuts.f 

   fortran routine where wbf selection are implemented (Deltajj, Mjj, CJV, Tag jet ID ).
   If you want to apply these selections you have to insert at top of the runstring the 
   word wbf in the .DAT file

4) Bin/REAL_TEST/submit.pl  --> perl script used to run mcfm jobs on LSF, it takes information from
   Bin/REAL_TEST/Global_CFG.cfg --> here you specify which HiggsMass, Factorization and Rinormalization scale (as fraction of HiggsMass)
                                    Number of mcfm call for each iteration for Real and Virtual part (number of iteration 10 + 10 are set 
                                    as default in Template.DAT), name of Template .DAT file,  the directory BaseDir where the .DAT file will be
                                    create (different .DAT for each HiggsMass, Fac and Rin scale, and independent NRun for each combination).  

   Bin/REAL_TEST/Template.DAT ---> is the template .DAT file used for crate the other ones. Inside all the possible final state selections are chosen.

5) Analyis.cxx is a c++ code for Anlayse the results of mcfm and compare them with powheg.

   First of all generate the list of real and virtual samples obtained by mcfm through

  -->ls Virtual/ | grep HWW2jt_virt_mstw8nl_ | grep .dat | tr "w" " " | tr "d" " " | tr "_" " " | awk '{print "echo @w"$7"_"$8"_"$9"_"$10"_"$11"_"$12" "$9" "$10" "$11" "$12"@ >> Virtual.txt"}' | tr "@" "\""  | /bin/sh

  -->ls Real/ | grep HWW2jt_real_mstw8nl_ | grep .dat | tr "w" " " | tr "d" " " | tr "_" " " | awk '{print "echo @w"$7"_"$8"_"$9"_"$10"_"$11"_"$12" "$9" "$10" "$11" "$12"@ >> Real.txt"}' | tr "@" "\""  | /bin/sh

  then compile Analysis.cxx through:

  -->g++ -Wall `root-config --libs --glibs --cflags` -o Analysis Analysis.cxx

  Run the code in this way:

  --> ./Analysis Virtual.txt Real.txt output.root XS_powheg.txt


  where Virtual.txt and  Real.txt are the list of mcfm output, XS_powheg.txt is the file with mcfm effective cross section and up/down error
  output.root is the outputfile for plots and distribution of real and virtual xs for different Higgs Mass and scale.
